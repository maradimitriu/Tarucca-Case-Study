# Tarucca – Case Study

This repository contains the **Tarucca Case Study**, focused on analyzing and correcting heading and position data derived from CCOG and VCOG measurements.

## Repository Structure

- **`main.ipynb`**  
  The primary Jupyter Notebook.  
  It contains the full analysis pipeline, including:
  - data loading,
  - preprocessing,
  - visualization,
  - correction attempts.

- **CCOG / VCOG data files**  
  The repository includes **CCOG and VCOG CSV files for Experiments 1 and 2**, already provided with the inferred column headers used in the notebook.

## Methodology Walkthrough

A step-by-step explanation of the methodology is presented here: https://youtu.be/qoSE_-GI3AU

This video also includes the algebraic formulas used for predicting cable location.

## How to Use

1. Open `main.ipynb`.
2. Ensure the provided CCOG and VCOG data files are in the expected paths.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Notes

- The provided column headers for CCOG and VCOG are inferred and documented directly in the notebook.
- Experiments 1 and 2 are used as the primary reference cases for validation and comparison.
